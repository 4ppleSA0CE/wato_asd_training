"wato -all build" to build all containers from docker files

3.2.4:
Manufactoring plants can be used to describe the ASD infrastructure. Each plant (node) is designed for a specific function (core logic), and thus has the necessary tools and only those tools to reduce clutter. As a task is completed it communicates  and passes its output to a different plant for further processing. All the plants work in junction to transform the initial inputs to correct outputs.

In the dockerfile for transformer, remove the last CMD to launch the transformer node when the container starts.
